## Object-Centric Video and Sensor Mining

The file `gui.py` starts the graphical user interface of our software prototype and guides the user through the individual steps.
To run the file, execute the following command:
```
python3 gui.py
```

The following screenshot shows the object labeling step of the prototype.
