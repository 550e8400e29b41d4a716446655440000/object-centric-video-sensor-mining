# Unstructured Data in Object-Centric Process Mining

This repository contains the source code and online appendix for the paper 'Refining the Process Picture: Unstructured Data in Object-Centric Process Mining'. 
For a more comprehensive overview of the approach we refer to the paper.


## Installation

Execute the following commands to check out the repository, and create a new Python virtual environment.

```
git clone https://github.com/550e8400e29b41d4a716446655440000/object-centric-video-sensor-mining

## Object-Centric Video and Sensor Mining

The file `gui.py` starts the graphical user interface of our software prototype and guides the user through the individual steps.
To run the file, execute the following command:
```
python3 gui.py
```

The following screenshot shows the object labeling step of the prototype used on the Solve4X dataset ([Chvirova et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2024.110716)).
